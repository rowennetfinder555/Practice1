# python-machine-learning-book

*Python Machine Learning* code repository.

What you can expect are 400 pages rich in useful material just about everything you need to know to get started with machine learning ... from theory to the actual code that you can directly put into action! This is not yet just another "this is how scikit-learn works" book. I aim to explain all the underlying concepts, tell you everything you need to know in terms of best practices and caveats, and
we will put those concepts into action mainly using NumPy, scikit-learn, and Theano.

You are not sure if this book is for you? Please checkout the excerpts from the [Foreword](./docs/foreword_ro.pdf) and [Preface](./docs/preface_sr.pdf), or take a look at the [FAQ](#faq) section for further information.

> *Sebastian Raschka’s new book, Python Machine Learning, has just been released. I got a chance to read a review copy and it’s just as I expected - really great! It’s well organized, super easy to follow, and it not only offers a good foundation for smart, non-experts, practitioners will get some ideas and learn new tricks here as well.*  
– Lon Riesberg at [Data Elixir](http://dataelixir.com/issues/55#start)

> *Superb job! Thus far, for me it seems to have hit the right balance of theory and practice…math and code!*   
– [Brian Thomas](http://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2015/writing-pymle.html#comment-2295668894)

> *I've read (virtually) every Machine Learning title based around Scikit-learn and this is hands-down the best one out there.*
